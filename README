ant-tools facilitates the extraction of variant annotation from the .ant files produced by Illumina sequencing applications.


Requirements:
Python 2.7


Build Requirements:
mono
glibc


Usage:

  AnnotationWriter antFileName [--validate] [--stats] [--range RANGE] [--bed]
  
  antFileName: the fully qualified path to the .ant file.
  
  Options:
    --validate: validates that the ANT file is in the correct structure.
    --stats: provides a summary of annotation version, contents, etc.
    --all: specifies that empty records (i.e. no annotation) should be included in the output.
    --range=RANGE: allows the specification of a range over which to dump annotations, where RANGE is: CHR:START-STOP.
    --bed=PATH specifies an input BED file indicating the regions for which to export annotation.
    --bedout: specifies that the output should be BED-like in format, i.e. CHROM	START	STOP	{JSON_DATA}
